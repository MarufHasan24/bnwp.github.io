                <h3>Wiki Loves Children</h3>
                <p>Wiki Loves Children (WLC) is an online initiative aimed at improving Wikipedia’s content on
                    children’s issues, rights, and well-being. We strive to make vital information on these
                    topics accessible to a global audience.</p>
                <p>WLC was inspired by alarming statistics from UNICEF, which reports that over half of the
                    world’s children experience severe violence, with South Asia accounting for 64% of these
                    cases. Despite the urgency, Wikipedia lacks sufficient coverage of issues like child abuse
                    and neglect.</p>
                <p>Founded in 2021, WLC began with a successful event on Bengali Wikipedia. Now, we’re back with
                    a renewed mission to raise awareness and empower communities to address these critical
                    issues. Our goal is to highlight the importance of education, prevention, and support in
                    combating violence against children.</p>

                <h3>Wikivoyage Article Writing Contest</h3>
                <p>The Wikivoyage Article Writing Contest is an annual event aimed at improving content,
                    building, and retaining an independent and self-governing community that adheres to
                    Wikivoyage's policies. It is hosted on Bangla Wikivoyage to coincide with World Tourism Day.
                    The 2025 edition will mark its third year.</p>
                <p>In last year's competition, participants created 1,000 articles, achieving twenty times the
                    initial target. A total of 355 users registered, but 76 submitted articles using the
                    Fountain tool, 71 of whom were newcomers. The word count on Bangla Wikivoyage increased from
                    0.47 million to 41 million as a result of the competition. Bangla Wikivoyage’s ranking based
                    on article count rose from 19th to 13th.</p>

                <h3>Train the newcomers: a video tutorial project</h3>
                <p>A long-standing complaint from newcomers is the lack of video resources to support their
                    training. During every edit-a-thon and outreach project, we repeatedly hear this concern.
                    Although we have made individual attempts in the past, these efforts have failed due to
                    limited resources. Therefore, as part of this project, we plan to create a series of video
                    tutorials organized into a playlist. These videos will be used to train newcomers and help
                    retain them in the community.</p>

                <h3>Wiki Loves Women</h3>
                <p>We, at Bangla Wikipedia, organize a month-long edit-a-thon every year on Women’s Day to
                    address gender gaps on Bangla Wikipedia. Previous organizers of these edit-a-thons have
                    agreed to incorporate this event under this initiative starting in March 2026. Our goal is
                    to reduce content-related gender gaps and encourage more women to contribute. We plan to
                    collaborate with WikiNondini, a local women’s Wikimedia group, to achieve these objectives.
