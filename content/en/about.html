    <h2>About Bangla WikiConnect</h2>
    <p>Bangla WikiConnect is a collaborative initiative focused on enhancing and expanding Wikipedia’s content
        in Bengali. Through a variety of engaging contests, edit-a-thons, and training programs, we aim to
        develop high-quality, inclusive content on Wikipedia and its sister projects such as Wikiquote,
        Wikivoyage, Wikibooks, and Wiktionary.</p>
    <p>Our mission is to foster a more informed, educated, and active community that contributes to the digital
        knowledge repository. By providing a platform for new contributors, training aspiring leaders, and
        promoting content diversity, we ensure the continued growth of the Bangla language on Wikimedia
        projects. <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Bangla_WikiConnect" class="meta-link">
