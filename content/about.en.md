Bangla WikiConnect is a collaborative initiative focused on enhancing and expanding Wikipediaâ€™s content in Bengali. Through a variety of engaging contests, edit-a-thons, and training programs, we aim to develop high-quality, inclusive content on Wikipedia and its sister projects such as Wikiquote, Wikivoyage, Wikibooks, and Wiktionary.

Our mission is to foster a more informed, educated, and active community that contributes to the digital knowledge repository. By providing a platform for new contributors, training aspiring leaders, and promoting content diversity, we ensure the continued growth of the Bangla language on Wikimedia projects.
