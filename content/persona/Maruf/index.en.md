Hi! I'm **Maruf Hasan** (‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶Ç‡¶≤‡¶æ: ‡¶Æ‡¶æ‡¶∞‡ßÅ‡¶´ ‡¶π‡¶æ‡¶∏‡¶æ‡¶®, IPA: /maruf hasan/) a **Wikipedian, full-stack web developer, and Windows app developer**, passionate about **knowledge sharing and open collaboration**. Currently studying **Architecture at Khulna University of Engineering & Technology**, I love to combine technical skills with creative problem-solving in my work.  

Since **2021**, I‚Äôve made **140,000+ edits** and created **100+ Wikipedia articles**, with **five earning Good Article status**. My contributions focus on **Chemistry, Islam, and Translation**, and I actively participate in **WikiProject Chemistry** and **WikiProject Islam**. Beyond editing, I develop tools to support the Wikimedia community‚Äîincluding **[Checkmate](https://checkmate.toolforge.org/)**, a **powerful Toolforge tool for organizing and managing edit-a-thons**. With Checkmate, organizers can **track contributions, set templates, and monitor progress** through an intuitive dashboard, making edit-a-thon management smoother and more efficient.  

As a developer, I build **full-stack web apps (Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB)** and **Windows applications (C#, PowerShell, VBScript)**, always prioritizing **user-friendly and scalable solutions**.  

Outside of coding and editing, I enjoy **illustration, 3D modeling, reading, and gaming**, and I love exploring new ways to merge technology with community-driven projects.
